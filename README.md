#SimpleCalculator
This Java program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to input two numbers, then presents a menu for selecting an operation. After performing the chosen operation, the program displays the result and asks if the user would like to continue. The program includes error handling for invalid inputs and prevents division by zero. The calculator continues to run until the user opts to exit by entering 0.
To run the program, compile it using javac SimpleCalculator.java and execute with java SimpleCalculator. The program requires JDK 8 or higher.

#SimpleBanking
This Java-based console application allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, and check balances. Each account is identified by a unique name and starts with a balance of 0.0. The program validates user inputs, prevents invalid transactions (e.g., negative deposits or overdrafts), and provides clear feedback for each operation. Users can perform multiple transactions in one session via a simple menu interface. To run, clone the repository, compile with javac SimpleBanking.java, and execute with java SimpleBanking. Requires JDK 8 or higher. 

#StudentManagementSystem
This Java console application manages student records by allowing users to add, update, remove, and view student details. Each student is uniquely identified by an ID and includes attributes like name, age, and course. Input validation ensures accuracy for ID and age, with clear feedback for successful actions or errors, such as when a student is not found.
The program features a menu-driven interface, storing all student data in an ArrayList for dynamic management. To run, compile with javac StudentManagementSystem.java and execute using java StudentManagementSystem. It requires JDK 8 or higher.
